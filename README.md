To run the project, you must need a JRE on your computer.

To excecute the project, you must go to the directory PROJECT_LOCATION/GameOfLife/out/production/GameOfLife/sample/ 
then excecute the command "java Main"

You'll see a window, then edit the number of columns, number of lines, number of generations and choose the image to consider (you can get any image from web, and i putted some examples on the project directory with the dimension of each image in it's name).
